# [Telys](https://github.com/mikeday37/telys) v0.1 - Early Prototype - Under Construction
- Project Goal: *Conversational AI with power-user LTM*
- Personal Goals: *Hands-on exploration of custom LTM strategies, sharpen my AI and full-stack skillset, etc.*

This project has just begun.

Telys 0.1 will be a prototype that supports a local model via a native backend, manual LTM injection, and a basic chat interface. It will not yet include model switching, OpenAPI access, automated LTM retrieval, or web search integration, etc.

## Name Derivation
Telys is a constructed word representing my desire for a better ChatGPT experience and deeper understanding of LTM strategies for Conversational AI.

### **Telys** *(noun, singular)*
**Pronunciation:** /ˈtɛlɪs/
#### **Etymology**
- Derived from Greek:
  - **τέλος (telos)** – *purpose, ultimate goal*
- Influenced by Latin:
  - **Elysium** – *a place of perfect bliss, paradise*
- Evokes higher knowledge, intentionality, and an elevated experience of intelligence.
